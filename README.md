# Intermittent Routing Issues in React Router v6

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with React Router v6 where route rendering becomes unpredictable.  The application intermittently displays incorrect components or blank screens, making it difficult to debug.

## Problem

The `App.js` file shows a basic React Router v6 setup. Despite a seemingly correct configuration, the application sometimes fails to render routes correctly, potentially due to an unusual interaction within the application's lifecycle or a subtle conflict in the order of routes.  The issue is intermittent, making it hard to pinpoint the root cause consistently.

## Solution

The solution often involves meticulous review of component lifecycles, potential race conditions, and careful examination of route nesting and priorities. In this case, additional context or data that triggers the issue would be needed for a more targeted solution.  The `AppSolution.js` file offers one potential approach. Note: This solution might not directly address all possible instances of this problem, as the root cause of such intermittent behavior can be nuanced and context-dependent. A detailed explanation of the situation that triggers the bug would improve the diagnosis and remedy.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Observe the intermittent rendering issues by navigating between routes.
